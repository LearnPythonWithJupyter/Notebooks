    "- While filling out the online store, you realize that you want to minimize errors that could compromise revenue. Thus, you make the attributes representing price and discount private and create get and set methods to access them. In addition, you realize that you need to include the tax amount in the calculation of the final price. Therefore, you implement a private method that calculates the tax amount and modify `calculate_price()` accordingly:"
